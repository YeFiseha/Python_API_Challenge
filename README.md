In this assigment, we conducted analyed two things. First, we looked at weather conditions of randomly selected cities accross the world and assessed the relationship between weather conditions of the cities and their geograhic locations. Secondly, we selected cities with ideal weather condition and identified nearest hotels nearest to our preferred locations in these cities.

# Findings
Relationships between weather conditions and geographic locations of cities based on categories of Northern and Southern hemisphere show
(1) there is strong positive linear relationship between latitudes and temprature in the Southern hemisphere, while there is a strong negative linear relationship between latitudes and temprature in the Northern hemisphere.
(2) there is no clear relationship between the humidity and latitude for both the Northern and Southern hemispheres.
(3) there is no clear relationship between cloudiness and latitude for both the Northern and Southern hemispheres.
(4) there is no clear relationship between wind speed and latitude for both the Northern and Southern hemispheres.

Based on preferred ideal weather conditions, four cities have been identified for vacation. Further, based on selected geographic locations 3 nearest hotels, with 10,000 meter radius, have been identified in three of the cities (one per city). For one of the selected vacation places, hotel was not found witin the preferred geographic radius.
